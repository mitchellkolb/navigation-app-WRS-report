# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to make an app that will assist blind and visually impaired people so they can navigate indoors. We want to be able to help people using our design. This will be done by using the agile process where we will establish the requirements, design, test and deploy our prototype. The application will be using things such as voice over and assistive technology in order to make it effective in helping the user. The application implementation will be done using a prototyping software that allows us to test the user interface, as well as design.
